# <ins> Summary </ins>

The data shows the activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August.
The majority of the rides were taken by male users during 7:00-9:00AM and 5:00-7:00PM. This could possibly imply that these services are used as an alternate to public transport.

Additionally we could collect data for the entire year, more specifically so see seasonal trends and how holidays would effect the usage of this service
